	<h2>Mission</h2>
	<p><i>Create a cool web enviroment for flightgear that in interative, informative and fun for anyone</i></p>
	
	<h2>Intro</h2>
	<p>This is an idea by {link user='ac001'} towards creating an integrated web enviroment for {$Site->tm}. Having 
	spend some time in webdevelopment, and over the years attempting various stratergies towards solving problems,
	flight gear is fun, and one we harness the web, then we can have much more fun.</p>

	<p>So the idea of this site at the moment is to demonstrate a framework thats easy to use and extensible. There
		are a few design gloals, and one of them is to make it easy for a new hacker to understand.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Site</b> - all the various <i>subdomains, sites, zones</i> are clearly defined</li>
		<li><b>Section</b> - the top level <i>areas</i> </li>
		<li><b>Page</b> - a second level area within a section</li>
		<li><b>{$Site->id}/{$Site->section}/</b> - site/section/ - page is missing </li>
	</ul>

	<p>The project's source is a <b>complete</b> package and includes all libs and elements required to run on a LAMP stack. Some minor configuration 
     is required to get it running anywhere. This is a <code>git clone</clone> and is updated via <code>git pull</clone> on a cron.</p>
      at currently hosted and availabeGitHub<a href="{$Site->git_url}">{$Site->git_url}</a>
	</p>
	
	<p>To get help, make suggestions, get commit acccess then contact <b>ac001</b> on irc</p>

	<p>The "site" is a bit of a lightweight framework that uses smarty templating. Hopefully this section will
		take you throught the steps to get up and running.</p>

	<p>The "design" of this site is intended to be flexible, including more development toward's multi lang and automation.</p>
